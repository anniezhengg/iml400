      <h1>Summaries</h1>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p class="text">
        “Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers” discusses the places that
        technology has filled our lives post-pandemic. While technologies like
        Zoom and Amazon have helped with communication and convenience, other
        digital surveillance technologies used for contact tracing have begun
        harming populations at risk – for instance, social media could get you
        arrested and drones made for war are used over protests. “The Poetry of
        Tools” urges us to deconstruct the daily technological tools we use and
        reconsider their poetic potential by highlighting early influential
        digital artworks, performing data, removing form from purpose, exploring
        user errors, and revisiting old works. Personally, I really enjoyed
        reading about some of the works in the ‘Error’ section, specifically
        “Align Text”, which manipulates Google Translate’s app to find English
        words on a keyboard to translate. Lastly, I read the
        “Computer-programmed Choreography” chapter in “Cybernetic Serendipity:
        The Computer and the Arts”. This chapter described experiments using a
        computer’s randomly selected actions and positions to choreograph a
        dance, which since then has been tried out by at least one group of
        dancers.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The readings this week covered some of the different ways that digital
        care spaces can be fostered and promoted, from both online and offline
        avenues. In her Eyeo talk, Mother Cyborg described the different areas
        of technology and the Internet that she has taught in an effort to
        create a more collaborative, just, and accessible digital world in
        response to the inequalities of digital access and literacy. I thought
        it was interesting that her education programs for these digital
        platforms and spaces were organized the old school way through word of
        mouth and physical zines. The Virtual Care Lab and CLOUD9 are
        representations of traditional digital care spaces that use digital
        spaces to bring people with similar interests together through hosting
        events and curating projects. The Virtual Care Lab had all these little
        interactive details scattered throughout the site that enforced the
        concept of digital care – there was a little doodle at the top of one of
        the pages I went on that you could click on to expand it and finding
        that out made me really happy. The CLOUD9 website’s aesthetic was quite
        soothing as everything was cloud themed. As well, the 48hr Party video
        seemed to provide a space for people to connect and have fun with each
        other even over Zoom during the pandemic.

      <h2>Week 5</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The New Organs illuminated the sheer extent of how our data is tracked
        and used on the Internet – we are categorized into groups for the sole
        reason for advertisers to target us better. Platforms that we often use,
        like Facebook, do not appear to exist solely for connecting people to
        each other, rather they are to connect people with advertisers. The
        website itself stood out to me as well – the simple layout of rows upon
        rows of ears that change to data helped me visualize the sheer amount of
        specific and personal information about myself that is probably out
        there on the Internet, stored and leveraged by advertisers. The Building
        Consentful Tech Zine acted as a breath of fresh air after The New Organs
        website – the zine itself was welcoming, easily readable, and took into
        account measures of consent (it had content warnings). This zine talked
        about our digital bodies scattered throughout the Internet and urged
        both nontech and tech people to hold platforms and digital spaces
        accountable for breaching consent. It also imagines what tech would be
        like with consent at its core, proposing ideas such as only allowing
        individual users to hold the decryption key to their personal info as
        well as implementing community accountability. Lastly, it adopts the
        same consent guidelines as Planned Parenthood (freely given, reversible,
        informed, enthusiastic, and specific), drawing parallels between consent
        to our physical bodies and digital ones. Togethernet acts as an example
        of what tech spaces could look like if consent and transparency were to
        be prioritized; it is a collaborative archiving software that values
        digital practices like the right to be forgotten, and it was made very
        clear which one of the two channels, Ephemeral and Archival, is private
        and which one is public. Their goal seems to be to make the public and
        private on the Internet more transparent with the hope that digital
        rights will become more widely practiced.

      <h2>Week 6</h2>
      <p class="text">
        “What are the characteristics that are distinct to Indigenous
        technology?” seems like it is a manifesto that outlines how Indigenous
        technology seeks to connect with the world and with their community. I
        thought it was interesting that the characteristics mentioned are
        similar to Indigenous attitudes and values in regards to the land and
        their community in general, emphasizing meaningful relationships between
        technology, spirituality, and honoring their ancestry. I thought the
        Indigemoji website was representative of some of the qualities of
        Indigenous tech that was brought up in the manifesto: it is accessible
        through its spoken and written Arrernte dialects as well as English for
        anyone open to learning about their culture, it connects with the land
        and their spirituality through the diverse representations in the
        emojis, and it hugely emphasizes and documents how involved the
        community was throughout the whole creation process. To someone who does
        not know much about Arrernte culture, this site was easy to navigate and
        their intention was very clear – I felt that I gained a better
        understanding of what values and symbols are important to them and I
        have a lot of respect for this project. “Post-Colonial Computing”
        discusses several tactics to reimagine and reread postcolonial
        technology and science, among which cover deconstructing the
        intersections between technology and culture as well as regarding
        indigenous technologies in a similar way to how we treat Western
        technology rather than as inherently different. It also emphasizes that
        rather than trying to reform design, we should instead focus on
        non-mainstream forms of design to understand mainstream computing.

      <h2>Week 9</h2>
      <p class="text">
        In her TED talk, artist Christine Sun Kim discusses how and why she
        chose to reclaim her experiences with sound in an audio-centric world.
        She explains her connections between ASL and music, comparing signing to
        playing a chord on a piano, while simply speaking out loud is similar to
        playing one note. She leaves listeners with the hope that ASL can
        eventually develop its own form of currency and value without sound. I
        also thought her works were pretty cool because they play with how
        sound, or the implication of sound, can change how we view a stationary
        object. I thought this podcast was really interesting because it
        addressed curb cuts, a small fix to help a disadvantaged population, yet
        I had taken these for granted and never thought about why they exist. Ed
        Roberts' story made me want to learn more about his life’s work and the
        rest of the Rolling Quads. As well, the end of the podcast in particular
        made me think about other “curb cuts” that ended up benefiting everyone
        else as well, and how we never really think about its design elements
        unless it becomes an obstacle to us. I think that p5.js’ “Our Focus on
        Access” document is quite an important and respectable step for the
        p5.js community. I do agree that continuing to add more features that do
        not increase access would only further distance people who have been
        excluded before, and that this document encourages more diverse voices
        to contribute to the library. I also like that it defines what kinds of
        access it hopes to increase, listing a broad range of groups. As this
        was created in 2019, I am curious what features were added to p5.js
        between then and now.
      </p>

      <h2>Week 10</h2>
      <p class="text">
        To be quite honest, I’m still a bit confused about how the crypto market
        works and why NFTs are so highly valued, even after this week’s
        readings. From what I understand, NFTs are non-fungible tokens, meaning
        that you would be owning the rights to the original work, and the major
        debate around them is on the enormous energy amounts it takes to mint
        one NFT on the blockchain. I thought “HERE IS THE ARTICLE YOU CAN SEND
        TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAY ‘BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WITH CRYPTOART
        WILL BE SOLVED SOON, RIGHT?’” was the most interesting, since it covered
        a perspective on NFTs that I feel like is often overlooked and lost. It
        talks about how it seems that the reason why the marketplace hasn’t
        changed to a more sustainable, less energy-expensive way of mining
        crypto or minting on the blockchain is that the primary value and
        incentive is money. To me, this argument is one that I agree with to
        some level, because after looking at some of the artwork on the NFT
        sites, I honestly did not see nor understand why collectors would pay so
        much money for them. The intention of publishing digital images and
        videos is for free mass consumption, where anyone can “own” or view a
        copy of it, but with NFTs, I simply don’t understand why there are
        people paying so much money for the original when it doesn’t seem all
        that different to me to download the image online. It seems that the
        goal of people involved in collecting NFTs is to enjoy the exclusivity
        that money can provide them with digital ownership, making digital
        objects unnecessarily scarce.

      <h2>Week 10</h2>
      <p class="text">
        For the Google Creative Lab, I chose to focus on NSynth: Sound Maker. I
        thought this was really fun to fool around with because the given
        possible combinations weren’t only legitimate instruments, it also
        included things like dog sounds, thunder, and a guitar but reversed. I
        also liked how you could decide the ratio of the two mixed sounds with
        each other. It was interesting to see how the wackiest combinations (my
        favorite being “dog” and “reverse guitar”) could sound relatively decent
        simply because they had the same pitch and timbre. It’s built with
        Nsynth, which is a research project that trained a neural network on
        over 300,000 instrument sounds, allowing users to combine these sounds.
        To be honest, not super sure how it works, but this experiment was fun
        to play around with. Anatomy of an AI System was interesting to me
        because it used the example of Amazon’s Echo to illustrate the wide
        reaching effects of manufacturing and distributing such a technology. It
        examined the supply chain, focusing specifically on the devastating
        environmental effects and the exploitation of cheap/free human labor in
        dangerous conditions. It also talked about how the people/corporations
        on top benefit the most despite not having to risk their lives at all.
        This article also touched on how AI systems are trained through data
        sets that are possessed by a few companies, and most of these data sets
        come from data captured from us, and we sometimes unknowingly train AI
        systems for free, like with Google’s reCAPTCHA. I already knew a bit
        about the environmental and social effects of creating a technological
        product, but I didn’t know about what went into training an AI system,
        so it was fascinating to read about how we are all involved in making
        tomorrow’s machines smarter and more “human”, but at the cost of our own
        data and privacy. On the human (un)limited site, I explored Alias more
        in depth because I thought it would be fitting after reading the AI
        System article. I really like the concept behind it because it aims to
        make users of smart home devices more active (by letting them change the
        wake up command name) and it protects their privacy by only letting
        Google listen when Alias is activated. I also liked that the creators
        included the source code and step by step instructions so that anyone
        with access to the proper materials would be able to replicate the
        project. This is a nice touch as corporations like Google and Amazon
        gatekeep their manufacturing processes to ensure that consumers can only
        buy their products instead of making their own.

      <h1>Questions</h1>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          What are your thoughts on computers replacing typically human jobs
          like choreographing dances? Is there any potential in computers aiding
          the production of art?
        </li>
        <li>
          How do you think this balance of technology being both good and
          harmful in society will change in five years? In ten years? What would
          cause these changes and how should we promote digital care?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you think reinventing social media platforms and other
          corporate-driven technologies to be more poetic would change the ways
          users interact with these platforms and with other users? How?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          What does digital care mean to you? Does it need to be a particular
          website or digital space? Or can it be an activity?
        </li>
        <li>
          I noticed that the Virtual Care Lab and CLOUD9 had little
          interactivities that elevated the digital care experience for the
          user. How can we creatively code to elevate or create more emotionally
          supportive digital experiences?
        </li>
        <li>
          As technology becomes more accessible and more resources become
          available online, what role do you think physical resources (paper,
          interacting in-person, etc.) will play in this?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Week 5</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          Do you currently take any measures to protect your data online? If you
          do, do you think these measures are accessible to the general public?
        </li>
        <li>
          If you were to design a consentful digital space, what
          practices/guidelines would you adopt?
        </li>
        <li>
          For anyone that doesn’t really share themselves online, if digital
          spaces were more like Togethernet, would you be more active? Or would
          you prefer more precautions and safety practices? What kinds and why?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Week 6</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          Can you think of any forms of Indigenous technology? If not, what does
          this tell us about visibility?
        </li>
        <li>
          What are your thoughts on the Indigemojis? Would you want to see them
          in other even more accessible places, like your emoji keyboard, or
          would that go against the intentions of the project?
        </li>
        <li>
          As people who are not part of the Indigenous community, what do you
          believe our role is?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Week 9</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          What kind of “curb cuts” can be implemented on the Internet/in
          technology?
        </li>
        <li>
          Do you think more online communities should follow p5.js’ steps to
          only add more features if they increase accessibility? Why or why not?
        </li>
        <li>
          The way that we express ourselves through spoken language already is
          exclusive, especially to communities that do not live in an
          audio-centric world. Are there changes to our shared languages, either
          online or in real life, that could be changed or adapted to increase
          inclusivity?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Week 10</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          What is your stance on NFTs and on the digital culture/environmental
          issues it enforces? Would you ever create NFTs?
        </li>
        <li>
          Everest Pipkin discusses this concept of how NFTs create artificial
          scarcity for digital objects. Do you agree, and if so, how would you
          counteract the effects of this?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there a difference between the value of owning the original digital
          object versus owning a copy of it? Does it enforce a certain type of
          exclusivity, and if so, what kind?
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Week 11</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          What are your thoughts on AI training sets? How might they be
          improved?
        </li>
        <li>
          What are your opinions on smart home devices and how they’re
          constantly listening? How do you protect your data?
        </li>
        <li>
          What would you consider a “good”, or non harmful, use of AI? Would it
          be closer to the AI experiments run by Google? Or is that project
          contradicting as it is run by a big corporation that collects your
          data?
        </li>
