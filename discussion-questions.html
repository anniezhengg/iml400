      <h1>Summaries</h1>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p class="text">
        “Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers” discusses the places that
        technology has filled our lives post-pandemic. While technologies like
        Zoom and Amazon have helped with communication and convenience, other
        digital surveillance technologies used for contact tracing have begun
        harming populations at risk – for instance, social media could get you
        arrested and drones made for war are used over protests. “The Poetry of
        Tools” urges us to deconstruct the daily technological tools we use and
        reconsider their poetic potential by highlighting early influential
        digital artworks, performing data, removing form from purpose, exploring
        user errors, and revisiting old works. Personally, I really enjoyed
        reading about some of the works in the ‘Error’ section, specifically
        “Align Text”, which manipulates Google Translate’s app to find English
        words on a keyboard to translate. Lastly, I read the
        “Computer-programmed Choreography” chapter in “Cybernetic Serendipity:
        The Computer and the Arts”. This chapter described experiments using a
        computer’s randomly selected actions and positions to choreograph a
        dance, which since then has been tried out by at least one group of
        dancers.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p class="text">The readings this week covered some of the different ways that digital care spaces can be fostered and promoted, from both online and offline avenues. In her Eyeo talk, Mother Cyborg described the different areas of technology and the Internet that she has taught in an effort to create a more collaborative, just, and accessible digital world in response to the inequalities of digital access and literacy. I thought it was interesting that her education programs for these digital platforms and spaces were organized the old school way through word of mouth and physical zines. The Virtual Care Lab and CLOUD9 are representations of traditional digital care spaces that use digital spaces to bring people with similar interests together through hosting events and curating projects. The Virtual Care Lab had all these little interactive details scattered throughout the site that enforced the concept of digital care – there was a little doodle at the top of one of the pages I went on that you could click on to expand it and finding that out made me really happy. The CLOUD9 website’s aesthetic was quite soothing as everything was cloud themed. As well, the 48hr Party video seemed to provide a space for people to connect and have fun with each other even over Zoom during the pandemic.

    <h2>Week 5</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The New Organs illuminated the sheer extent of how our data is tracked and used on the Internet – we are categorized into groups for the sole reason for advertisers to target us better. Platforms that we often use, like Facebook, do not appear to exist solely for connecting people to each other, rather they are to connect people with advertisers. The website itself stood out to me as well – the simple layout of rows upon rows of ears that change to data helped me visualize the sheer amount of specific and personal information about myself that is probably out there on the Internet, stored and leveraged by advertisers. The Building Consentful Tech Zine acted as a breath of fresh air after The New Organs website – the zine itself was welcoming, easily readable, and took into account measures of consent (it had content warnings). This zine talked about our digital bodies scattered throughout the Internet and urged both nontech and tech people to hold platforms and digital spaces accountable for breaching consent. It also imagines what tech would be like with consent at its core, proposing ideas such as only allowing individual users to hold the decryption key to their personal info as well as implementing community accountability. Lastly, it adopts the same consent guidelines as Planned Parenthood (freely given, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and specific), drawing parallels between consent to our physical bodies and digital ones. Togethernet acts as an example of what tech spaces could look like if consent and transparency were to be prioritized; it is a collaborative archiving software that values digital practices like the right to be forgotten, and it was made very clear which one of the two channels, Ephemeral and Archival, is private and which one is public. Their goal seems to be to make the public and private on the Internet more transparent with the hope that digital rights will become more widely practiced.

      <h2>Week 6</h2>
      <p class="text">
        “What are the characteristics that are distinct to Indigenous technology?” seems like it is a manifesto that outlines how Indigenous technology seeks to connect with the world and with their community. I thought it was interesting that the characteristics mentioned are similar to Indigenous attitudes and values in regards to the land and their community in general, emphasizing meaningful relationships between technology, spirituality, and honoring their ancestry. I thought the Indigemoji website was representative of some of the qualities of Indigenous tech that was brought up in the manifesto: it is accessible through its spoken and written Arrernte dialects as well as English for anyone open to learning about their culture, it connects with the land and their spirituality through the diverse representations in the emojis, and it hugely emphasizes and documents how involved the community was throughout the whole creation process. To someone who does not know much about Arrernte culture, this site was easy to navigate and their intention was very clear – I felt that I gained a better understanding of what values and symbols are important to them and I have a lot of respect for this project. “Post-Colonial Computing” discusses several tactics to reimagine and reread postcolonial technology and science, among which cover deconstructing the intersections between technology and culture as well as regarding indigenous technologies in a similar way to how we treat Western technology rather than as inherently different. It also emphasizes that rather than trying to reform design, we should instead focus on non-mainstream forms of design to understand mainstream computing.      </p>
      
        <h2>Week 9</h2>
      <p class="text">
        In her TED talk, artist Christine Sun Kim discusses how and why she chose to reclaim her experiences with sound in an audio-centric world. She explains her connections between ASL and music, comparing signing to playing a chord on a piano, while simply speaking out loud is similar to playing one note. She leaves listeners with the hope that ASL can eventually develop its own form of currency and value without sound. I also thought her works were pretty cool because they play with how sound, or the implication of sound, can change how we view a stationary object. I thought this podcast was really interesting because it addressed curb cuts, a small fix to help a disadvantaged population, yet I had taken these for granted and never thought about why they exist. Ed Roberts' story made me want to learn more about his life’s work and the rest of the Rolling Quads. As well, the end of the podcast in particular made me think about other “curb cuts” that ended up benefiting everyone else as well, and how we never really think about its design elements unless it becomes an obstacle to us. I think that p5.js’ “Our Focus on Access” document is quite an important and respectable step for the p5.js community. I do agree that continuing to add more features that do not increase access would only further distance people who have been excluded before, and that this document encourages more diverse voices to contribute to the library. I also like that it defines what kinds of access it hopes to increase, listing a broad range of groups. As this was created in 2019, I am curious what features were added to p5.js between then and now.

      <h1>Questions</h1>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
            What are your thoughts on computers replacing typically human jobs like choreographing dances? Is there any potential in computers aiding the production of art?

        </li>
        <li>
            How do you think this balance of technology being both good and harmful in society will change in five years? In ten years? What would cause these changes and how should we promote digital care?
        </li>
        <li>
            Do you think reinventing social media platforms and other corporate-driven technologies to be more poetic would change the ways users interact with these platforms and with other users? How?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
            What does digital care mean to you? Does it need to be a particular website or digital space? Or can it be an activity?
        </li>
        <li>
            I noticed that the Virtual Care Lab and CLOUD9 had little interactivities that elevated the digital care experience for the user. How can we creatively code to elevate or create more emotionally supportive digital experiences?
        </li>
        <li>
            As technology becomes more accessible and more resources become available online, what role do you think physical resources (paper, interacting in-person, etc.) will play in this?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Week 5</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          Do you currently take any measures to protect your data online? If you do, do you think these measures are accessible to the general public?        </li>
        <li>
          If you were to design a consentful digital space, what practices/guidelines would you adopt?        </li>
        <li>
          For anyone that doesn’t really share themselves online, if digital spaces were more like Togethernet, would you be more active? Or would you prefer more precautions and safety practices? What kinds and why?        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Week 6</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          Can you think of any forms of Indigenous technology? If not, what does this tell us about visibility?  </li>     
           <li>
            What are your thoughts on the Indigemojis? Would you want to see them in other even more accessible places, like your emoji keyboard, or would that go against the intentions of the project?       </li>
        <li>
          As people who are not part of the Indigenous community, what do you believe our role is?        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Week 9</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
          What kind of “curb cuts” can be implemented on the Internet/in technology?  </li>     
           <li>
            Do you think more online communities should follow p5.js’ steps to only add more features if they increase accessibility? Why or why not?       </li>
        <li>
          The way that we express ourselves through spoken language already is exclusive, especially to communities that do not live in an audio-centric world. Are there changes to our shared languages, either online or in real life, that could be changed or adapted to increase inclusivity?        </li>
      </ol>
