      <h1>Summaries</h1>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p class="text">
        “Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers” discusses the places that
        technology has filled our lives post-pandemic. While technologies like
        Zoom and Amazon have helped with communication and convenience, other
        digital surveillance technologies used for contact tracing have begun
        harming populations at risk – for instance, social media could get you
        arrested and drones made for war are used over protests. “The Poetry of
        Tools” urges us to deconstruct the daily technological tools we use and
        reconsider their poetic potential by highlighting early influential
        digital artworks, performing data, removing form from purpose, exploring
        user errors, and revisiting old works. Personally, I really enjoyed
        reading about some of the works in the ‘Error’ section, specifically
        “Align Text”, which manipulates Google Translate’s app to find English
        words on a keyboard to translate. Lastly, I read the
        “Computer-programmed Choreography” chapter in “Cybernetic Serendipity:
        The Computer and the Arts”. This chapter described experiments using a
        computer’s randomly selected actions and positions to choreograph a
        dance, which since then has been tried out by at least one group of
        dancers.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p class="text">The readings this week covered some of the different ways that digital care spaces can be fostered and promoted, from both online and offline avenues. In her Eyeo talk, Mother Cyborg described the different areas of technology and the Internet that she has taught in an effort to create a more collaborative, just, and accessible digital world in response to the inequalities of digital access and literacy. I thought it was interesting that her education programs for these digital platforms and spaces were organized the old school way through word of mouth and physical zines. The Virtual Care Lab and CLOUD9 are representations of traditional digital care spaces that use digital spaces to bring people with similar interests together through hosting events and curating projects. The Virtual Care Lab had all these little interactive details scattered throughout the site that enforced the concept of digital care – there was a little doodle at the top of one of the pages I went on that you could click on to expand it and finding that out made me really happy. The CLOUD9 website’s aesthetic was quite soothing as everything was cloud themed. As well, the 48hr Party video seemed to provide a space for people to connect and have fun with each other even over Zoom during the pandemic.

      <h1>Questions</h1>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
            What are your thoughts on computers replacing typically human jobs like choreographing dances? Is there any potential in computers aiding the production of art?

        </li>
        <li>
            How do you think this balance of technology being both good and harmful in society will change in five years? In ten years? What would cause these changes and how should we promote digital care?
        </li>
        <li>
            Do you think reinventing social media platforms and other corporate-driven technologies to be more poetic would change the ways users interact with these platforms and with other users? How?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>
            What does digital care mean to you? Does it need to be a particular website or digital space? Or can it be an activity?
        </li>
        <li>
            I noticed that the Virtual Care Lab and CLOUD9 had little interactivities that elevated the digital care experience for the user. How can we creatively code to elevate or create more emotionally supportive digital experiences?
        </li>
        <li>
            As technology becomes more accessible and more resources become available online, what role do you think physical resources (paper, interacting in-person, etc.) will play in this?
        </li>
      </ol>
