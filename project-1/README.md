[Cybernetic Garden](https://anniezhengg.github.io/iml400/project-1/) is an interactive web page inspired by the poem All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace by by Richard Brautigan.

### Description

My take on this was to create a digital care space that blends real elements and technological ones through archival and found images. The collage of images are draggable, allowing the user to "reinvent" or reorganize this digital face. Underneath, the user can ask the Magic 8 Ball about themselves. As well, the user can hover over the picture of baby me for a brief description or click around on the background for an interactive, starry surprise.

# Project 2: Painting By Ear

### Description

[Painting by Ear](https://painting-by-ear.glitch.me/) is an audio-visual painting self care space to connect with and relax with other users in the room through shared paintings and sounds. The canvas is separated into eight sections, each with their own corresponding color and musical note. You can sense other users' presence through the hearts that show up where they initially connect with the canvas. You can also hear the notes they play, pitched up one octave higher. Feel free to duet with them while you paint! Happy painting!

# Project 3: Seeds From the Starving Mind

### Description

[Seeds From the Starving Mind](https://seeds-from-the-starving-mind.glitch.me/) was named to reflect how I recognize my need for nutrients, or positive thoughts, in my mind, yet I continually struggle with this. This project surveys my insecurities and body dysmorphia in a way that is meaningful to me: it’s written in third person simply because I found after drafting this too many times, that this way is easier for me to write about myself; and the mouse cursor represents a floating entity that wants to change the narrative but has little control over its course of events. These two entities somewhat represent feuding sides of my mind. As well, I incorporated p5 sketches with ml5js to demonstrate my lived experience. Although this piece may not be entirely universal, it wasn’t created to resonate with everyone who stumbles upon it. It was created as an emotional release for myself as well as anyone who might be struggling with the same thoughts. While I may not be the best person to look up to in this area, I hope I at least let someone know that I understand. I just wanted to put a slice of my thoughts on the Internet, so do with it what you want!
